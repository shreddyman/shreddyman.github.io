                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act One: Prologue</h4>
                    <p>Seven years ago, there was a police officer named Reggie Fiddledibble. He was dying of paint poisoning due to the consumption of one too many Blue Bananas©. He was lying on the floor next to his bed—because he thought the floor was more comfortable—when he felt like not dying. Reggie pulled out his Enclosed Instruction Book and looked up the secrets to immortality. It had turned out that the secret to being immortal is by being Wario, going way too fast for everyone or drinking some “super-secret drinky thing” that they kept in Area 52, which is next door to Area 51. Reggie strapped on his trusty jetpack that he kept in his back pocket and walked to Area 52.</p>
                </div>

                <div id='a2'>
                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act Two: A Super Secret Lab Full of Plot Devices</h4>
                    <p>Twenty minutes later, he knocked on the front door of Area 52 and said that he needed the super-secret drinky thing and that if he didn’t get it he would explode. When he got inside, he took off his jetpack and flew over the senior scientist named Billiard Bobykinns. Billiard had worked there for seventy years, and then he got fired, rehired and then worked there for eighty-eight years after that. There was an awkward silence as they passed through the halls of the base, so Reggie tried to start a conversation. “So… you got any family?” Reggie questioned. Billiard just shrugged off the comment and kept walking with an emotionless expression. After an hour of silence, they arrived at the room where the super-secret drinky thing was <em>supposed</em> to be, but it wasn’t there. It turned out that Reggie’s arch-nemesis, Fiddle Reggiedibble, had already drunk it. “Oh no!” shouted Reggie, “How cood dis happon?!?” Approximately three seconds after he said this, there was a loud crushing noise.</p>
                    <p>“OH MY!” spoke Billiard, “The Ductapeuos Raptaerious (that’s ‘Duc-tape-ee-us rap-tair-ee-us’ for all you mispronouncing folks) has broken out of its cage” There was a loud roar followed by a Wilhelm Scream. “RUN, REGGIE, RUN!” shouted Billiard, “I’LL TAKE CARE OF THIS BEAST!!”</p>
                    <p>“IS THERE REALLY A REASON FOR THIS SECTION OF THE STORY TO HAVE ALL CAPS!??!?” asked Reggie.</p>
                    <p>“STOP BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL!” angrily yelled Billiard. Reggie ran from where the sound came from originally, but with every turn, the noises were in front and closer to him.</p>
                    <p>“It’s just one of those plot devices,” murmured Reggie. Then, Reggie remembered that he was suffering from paint poisoning, so he suddenly fell to a crawl. He tried to cower in a corner but the monster found him, and, despite Reggie’s girly screams of terror, covered his face with duct tape.</p>

                <div id='a3'>
                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act Three: The Driving Force</h4>
                    <p>When he regained consciousness, Reggie looked around and saw a bunch of scientists bound to the wall by duct tape. Reggie’s head felt quite heavy, too. When he felt his forehead, he felt a large metal object on it. He rushed to the nearest bathroom, which was three millimeters away, and looked in the mirror. There was a paper shredder attached to his cranium! Reggie dug at the duct tape but couldn’t get it off, for it was duct tape made in a Nokia factory! Reggie screamed and started to run in circles, but then he bruised his arm on the sink, bashed his shin on the toilet and then fell shredder first into the bathtub.</p>
                    <p>The sound of a shredder smashing porcelain awoke the Ductapeuos Raptaerious and sent it running towards his escaped victim. Reggie was just coming out of the bathroom when the Ductapeuos Raptaerious found him. Reggie shrieked. The Ductapeuos Raptaerious leaped at Reggie. Luckily for Reggie, the paper shredder randomly turned on, and the Ductapeuos Raptaerious jumped right into it and got shredded to bits. Despite being called the Ductapeuos Raptaerious, it was actually made of scotch tape. All of the duct tape, besides the strips attached to Reggie, dissipated, leaving Reggie to say “It’s another one of those plot devices.” All of the scientists lifted him up and chanted his name until they carried him to a hole in the wall and threw him in. On the other side of the hole, there was a room with a golden thing on the top. The golden thing started draining air into it, so Reggie had to just stand there while he got sucked up! He was falling down a golden shaft until it launched him outside. When he hit the ground, he exclaimed “Ow! That hurt so very much!”</p>

                <div id='a4'>
                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act Four: The Name and Plot</h4>
                    <p>Reggie liked the satisfaction of being praised as a superhero, so he decided to become one. After many tries on the name, he went through the names of “Super Shredder”, “Righteous Ripper” and “Doctor Dissection”, but he took a liking to the cheesiest name of all: Shreddyman. He strapped on his trusty jetpack and ran out of the supermarket that he was in for the last twenty minutes. As soon as his foot hit the pavement outside, there was an explosion down the street. It was his house! Smoke was encapsulating the entire lot, so he couldn’t see. However, with his super Shreddy Senses—which is totally not a rip-off of Spiderman—he was able to hear a moderately familiar laugh. “I can’t see through these clouds,” said Shreddyman, “I hope I can get rid of them.” Then he looked into the camera and said <strong><em class='annoying'>“GET THE HINT!?!?!1”</em></strong> Shreddyman ran into the flames and looked around, but the culprit was gone. “D’oh I missed!” said Shreddyman.</p>

                <div id='a5'>
                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act Five: The Rebuild</h4>
                    <p>Sure, Shreddyman could have just bought a new house, but then there isn’t any plot, and then the next few pages of this story would be blank. Shreddyman thought it would be appropriate to move to an undisclosed location on the moon and build a lair complete with a timeless butler, power armor, a cool grappling hook thingie and more plot devices like that. Shreddyman told me that if I said anything more about this scene he would shred up this story sooo… yep. There you go.</p>
                </div>

                <div id='a6'>
                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act Six: The Base</h4>
                    <p> As it turned out, the moon wasn’t the best place for a secret base. It sounded cool, but when it was all said and done, there was really no atmosphere (HAH! Get it? No? Aww…). Aside from that, now with the power armor equipped, Shreddyman could fly, shoot lasers and scan enemies with this really cool document scanner that comes with every “As seen on TV” shredder. Of course, for the scanner to work, the enemies have to go through the scanner, meaning they need to be paper thin, because it is “As seen on TV” material, but the concept was neat. Also it turned out that the timeless butler thing is copyrighted, so that guy lost his job, and Shreddyman got a maid instead. But then feminists tore down his lair, so he just bought a rented a one-bedroom apartment and called it a day.</p>
                </div>

                <div id='a7'>
                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act Seven: The Hunt</h4>
                    <p> Now that Shreddyman actually had a base, he could hunt down his enemy. He took off his trusty jetpack—because he knew a long journey awaited him—and busted out of his ceiling. He snapped his fingers, and the Shreddchopper© flew out of the sky and landed next to him. Then, Shreddyman launched his grappling hook at the side of the Shreddchopper™ and dragged it away.</p>
                </div>

                <div id='a8'>
                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act Eight: The Place</h4>
                    <p>Twenty minutes later, he arrived at his enemy’s secret base. He could tell it was evil because there were no signs labeling everything. He body slammed through the wall and found a bunch of dead bodies! What a heinous crime! He burst into the main room to find that he was in the morgue. He called the cops on everyone so they could be arrested for housing a corpse, which, I’m pretty sure, is probably illegal. Next door, there was a McMaggots, which Shreddyman called the cops on for poisoning food. Next door to that was a building with a large flashing sign that read <i>SECRET EVIL BASE</i> on it. “It couldn’t be that one!” said Shreddyman, who moved on to the next building to find his mother-in-law’s house. Shreddyman proceeded to run to the building with the large blinking sign.</p>

                <div id='a9'>
                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act Nine: The Old Guy</h4>
                    <p>In front of the building, there was a large fissure with one bridge stretching over it. There was an old man guarding it. “Stop!” Shouted the old man “Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, 'ere the other side he see.”</p>
                    <p>“Ok, what are your questions?” asked Shreddyman.</p>
                    <p>“WHAT is your name?”</p>
                    <p>“Sir Shreddyman of Detroit.”</p>
                    <p>“WHAT is your quest?”</p>
                    <p>“To find my greatest adversary!”</p>
                    <p>“WHAT is your favorite color?”</p>
                    <p>“Puke green.”</p>
                    <p>“Right. Off you go.” <i>What a plot device…</i> thought Shreddyman. </p>
                </div>

                <div id='a10'>
                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act Ten: The Inside of the Place</h4>
                    <p>Shreddyman walked up to the door and noticed that there was no door. The door kept on disappearing and reappearing. “That’s annoying,” mumbled Shreddyman. Suddenly John Cena punched a hole in the wall and walked out. Shreddyman took the opportunity and just jumped in. The inside of the evil base was very bright, so Shreddyman had to whip out one of his darks so he could see. Three miles down the hall there was a tiny door, a small door, a moderately small door, a regular door, a particularly large door, a bigger door, a slightly bigger door and a door that was seven times bigger than the last one. He couldn’t fit in the biggest one, which was mildly disappointing, so he had to go through the tiny door. Surprise, surprise, he didn’t fit, so he drank some of the super-secret drinky thingy, which he found under his bed after the Ductapeuos Raptaerious incident, making this entire story practically worthless. The super-secret drinky thingy didn’t shrink him, because it wasn’t a <em>cherry flavored</em> super-secret drinky thingy, but the original super-secret drinky thingy made him able to teleport, so it was all good anyway.</p>
                    <p>Shreddyman teleported to the other side of the tiny door with ease, but what was on the other side completely distracted him for twenty seconds. The room was only a wacky waving inflatable, arm-flailing tube man emporium, besides the door on the other side of the room. He went through the door and found himself in a highly realistic mall! Shreddyman made a break for the other side of the mall, but got sprayed in the face with perfume multiple times! Shreddyman crashed through the revolving doors and found himself right in front of a silhouette of the guy who blew up his house.</p>
                    <p>“So,” said the silhouette, “I see you made it past the tiny door and the super highly realistic mall, quite feats they are, but, however astounded I am that you didn’t die from all the perfume, you will still never beat me!” the silhouette stepped out of the shadows to reveal...</p>

                <div id='a13'>
                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act Thirteen: Who It Actually Was</h4>
                    <p>It was… DIBBLE FIDDLEREGGIE! Dibble Fiddlereggie turned to the point of view that us—the readers—are looking through, and said “I’m not Dibble Fiddlereggie anymore… now I’m EVILMAN!” Shreddyman did a very anticlimactic gasp. For the next twenty seconds, nobody moved. Mario came in and shamelessly promoted the Enclosed Instruction Book. Then, seven years later, the screen faded to black (but that’s racist, so it actually faded to a nice sepia rainbow monochrome (which is made by printing out a rainbow in grayscale, and then spilling coffee all over it)).</p>
                </div>

                    <h4 class='sticky whitebg'>Act Fourteen: Present Time (no it's not Christmas) (or his birthday) (or another holiday) (you know what I mean)</h4>
                    <p>Evilman, after being still for seven years, was very stiff and could barely move at all. Shreddyman, however, went and got a sandwich twenty minutes before the player finally closed all the doors in the hotel, because he could use his super Shreddy Senses to walk right through the sepia rainbow monochrome. Shreddyman walked up to Evilman and slapped him into defeat. “AUGH!” screeched Evilman, “YOU MAY HAVE WON THIS TIME, BUT I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE!”</p>
                    <p>Evilman jumped over Shreddyman with an incredible leap! He ran through the mall, being sprayed with perfume. Shreddyman gave chase, but also got perfumed. Evilman pulled out a can of canned bread (which was cherry flavored, btw) and shrunk so he could run through the door. Shreddyman just shredded through the door, because he thought that the main plot device wasn’t being used enough. Evilman ran outside and stopped. Shreddyman stopped right behind him. The old guy stood before them.</p>
                    <p>“WHAT is your name?” he asked.</p>
                    <p>“Evilman! Come on! I don’t have time for this!” shouted Evilman.</p>
                    <p>“WHAT is your quest?”</p>
                    <p>“To run away from the Shreddyman!”</p>
                    <p>“WHAT is the capital of Assyria?”</p>
                    <p>Evilman, stunned, shouted “I DON’T KNOW THAT!!”</p>
                    <p>Then, Evilman flew into the pit with a devastating “AUGH!!!” noise. Shreddyman had won. Just as Shreddyman was trying to go home he heard somebody call out to him.</p>
                    <p>“WHAT is your name?”</p>
                    <p>“Sir Shreddyman of Detroit”</p>
                    <p>“WHAT is your quest?”</p>
                    <p>“To go home.”</p>
                    <p>“WHAT is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?”</p>
                    <p>“What do you mean? An African or European swallow?”</p>
                    <p>“WHAT!?!? I DON’T KNOW THAT!!!” shouted the old man, who had the same fate as Evilman. “AUUUUGH” was the last word that Shreddyman heard that day, because he went home and decided to stay there until a sequel was written.</p>
